### **About me**
<p align="justify">
Hello! I'm Beyza KurtoÄŸlu, a bioengineer who specialises in bioinformatics with a strong background in biology, bioinformatic data analysis, programming languages, and rare diseases. My research is focused on integrating advanced computer science technologies with biological data to unravel the intricacies of diseases and gain comprehensive insights into their nature. I have great knowledge of data mining techniques, Linux/OS environment, and coding. Throughout my education, I enhanced my skills with academic and industrial experiences in addition to the modules of bioinformatics

As a dedicated bioinformatician, I know how to handle large datasets by considering the data type (e.g., the techniques and bioinformatic tools if it is genomic data or transcriptomic data) and I am expanding my skills by learning pipeline development with Snakemake and SQL.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you'd like to collaborate on bioinformatics, data science, data analysis projects or pipeline development.
