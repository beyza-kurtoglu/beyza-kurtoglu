### **About me**
<p align="justify">
I am a bioinformatician with a strong background in transcriptomics, bioinformatic data analysis and coding. My dissertation research was focused on developing a transcriptome-based variant calling pipeline and employing it on 10 patients diagnosed with Sotos syndrome. I have a great knowledge of data mining techniques, Linux/OS environment and R programming. My research interests include transcriptomics, variant calling analysis, rare diseases, pipeline development, cancer and systems biology.

As a dedicated bioinformatician, I know how to handle large datasets by considering the data type (e.g., the techniques and bioinformatic tools if it is genomic data or transcriptomic data) and I am expanding my skills by learning pipeline development with Snakemake and SQL.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on bioinformatics, data science, data analysis projects or pipeline development.
